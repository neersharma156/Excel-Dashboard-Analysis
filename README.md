# Excel- Vrinda Store Data Analysis
NeeR's first repository

This is My First Project in my Journey of becoming a Data Scientist. So this Project is having a special place in Life, because is gave me new confidence to go forward to my journey.
I make this project during my learning process from a video uploaded by 1 of my Teachers on Youtube "Rishabh Mishra" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9vjhj7_A4o

In this Project We discuss Detailed Sales Analysis of "Vrinda Store Product Sales"
It has various Bar graphs and pie charts of Orders in Store with Respect to Gender, States, Age of costumers, Various Channels via which sales happemned.

With the help of this analysis one can conclude that... 
1. Most of the costumers are Women
2. Maharashtra is the location where most of the Sale Happened
3. Amazon Played a big role in Sale of product followed by Myntra and Flipkart.
4. Major part of orders is placed by Age group between 34years to 59 years.
